          <pre> “A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a statistic”
-Joseph Stalin</pre>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            She took two turns down the hallway and ran, panting and heaving as the fabric of her dress, the same that made her feel so pretty last night now cast an unbearable weight. She lifted the dress by its hem, wiped the lone tear on her cheek, and continued to run.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            I have to save him; she spoke to herself, grit and determination coursing through her body. She pushed away every soldier who tried to stop her, screaming and cursing at them when they tried to stop her. Nothing would stop her today, not the greatest force in the planet was enough to break her will. She will save him today.
          </p>
          
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
           She ran and ran, never for once letting the sight of the two large bearded men pulling him away from her. They walked fast, holding him by his collar, dragging his pale, almost lifeless body into the wilderness. But she was not going to stand and there watch today. Today, even God would have to bow down to her will. The universe has to give in to her love for the husk of a man being dragged through the large hallway guarded by soldiers from both sides. She ran faster now, knowing she didn’t have much time. 
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            The three men are slowly turning into as shadow, as she realizes they are getting farther and farther. Fear courses through her veins, for she knew she did not have it in her to lose him again, to once again see him lying lifeless on the ground.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            Images of the last time run through her head. The three bullets on the right side of his chest. The bruise right above his elbows. The pocket of his shirt, half torn from the fight. His lip had a cut that bleed. His one tooth was missing. He lay on her lap, as she wept and wept seeing the sight of the man she had loved and worshiped for every moment of her adult life, slowly oozing out every ounce of life that was left in him. He caressed her face as he took his last breath, smiling at her face. And then his chest stopped beating, his hand fell off her face, his expression turning to that of peace.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            That lifeless expression of her husband’s body strikes lightning in her soul and she realizes she cannot go through that again. She needs to run faster, and she wills herself she stumbles upon a rock falls down.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            She wakes up to dim lights and her brother-in-law talking to a man wearing glasses. Her head hurts on the side where the rock hit her. She can slightly see a couple of drips penetrating her arm. She tries to figure out how and why she was here. But her head hurts again. Too much to take it. She drifts off again.
          </p>
          <pre style="text-align: center;"> ************************************ </pre>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">How long has it been since your brother passed? Three years now. But it’s like not even a day has passed for bhabhi. Tell me more about these fits. She runs down the hallway, just like that day when they took my brother. She takes us for the soldiers that guarded her way that day and pushes us away and screams at us. She runs and runs, screaming my brother’s name, till she falls down to the ground. </p>
          <pre style="text-align: center;"> ************************************ </pre>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">It’s been three years. The media has moved on to other things, and people went on with their lives. There were many flowers that arrived, leaders of the movement who came and expressed their sorrow, and told us how brave he was. The revolution won, the foreigners have been overthrown. It has all been three years. My daughter speaks now; our mother has grown older and weaker. Yet for bhabhi, the clock hasn’t ticked. She still lives the dreaded day three years ago, every day of her life.</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">They say time heals everything, Doc. How will she heal, if she doesn’t feel time? </p>
          <pre style="text-align: center;"> ************************************ </pre>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;"><em>This is an attempt to scale down and see revolutions at a singular individualistic level. We read about revolutions, and we see their outcomes, and how they change the society. But at what cost? Isn’t each human life lost more regretted than the outcome of the total loss in numbers? Have we become barbaric enough to log and pile dead people into registers and datasheets?</em><br>
            <em>Every single human life is as cherished as are the millions.</em> </p>

          <h2 class="title">The Empty Mindstreet</h2>
          <p class="postDate">posted on: 7 January 2014</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            I startle awake as the inner dawn broke. I could feel my being come back to life again. Unhurried, at peace, I feel at ease with myself. I loiter around the pleasant mindstreet contented with the feeling of fullness. My unshapely features glower with satisfaction. I loiter around some more, smiling at myself. Looking around, feeing so happy in my mindstreet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            But as I go on, I realize I do not see any familiar turns, corners, or subways. I wander some more, looking for some semblance of recognition. Maybe the fir tree down the lane, maybe the unused subway, but to no avail. My ears stand attentive, trying to grasp the familiar sound of leaves rustling, or the distant howl of a dog, but again in vain. Drops of sweat, or tears, or both trickles down my chin onto the unfamiliar lane in my which I am. I look up in exasperation as I realize, I am alone in this empty mindstreet.
          </p>
          <!-- <pre>code goes here</pre> -->
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
           The heaviness of my solidarity burdens my being. I know I need to rest. I let myself relax. But I can’t. My being agonizes as alienated emotions run through it.  Any possibility of a path to familiarity, to recognition seems unlikely. I try to still myself, as my being cripples from tiredness and fragility. Slowly, yet not peacefully, I lose myself in this empty mindstreet.
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            When I wake up, I am at peace again. I am flushed by familiar emotions of plenum and serenity. I happily come to the realization that I have returned to my mindstreet. I open my eyes to drink in my familiar view, only to realize that I am in the very same place I was. But I no longer feel alone, scared. I feel at ease. I realize this is my mindstreet, only that it’s no longer empty. It has me.

          <h2 class="title">Will I remain, will I cease?</h2>
          <p class="postDate">posted on: 3 December 2013</p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            It’s been a long while since he last came. The emerald shining at the end of the room on the doorknob the only hope left. I sit mum, waiting, patient. Yet a tinge of fear runs across my small being. <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            What was that? I react, my wholeness shuddering with anticipation as I hear a distant click, my attention undivided to it as ever. My senses tingle as the emerald on the doorknob shows movement, subtle, yet so meaningful. A motion so small, yet so powerful. A ray enters, then a beam. I glisten, bathing in the glory.  The beam grows larger, powerful, filling the room with its bright crimson glow. A sudden burn on my being divides my attention. My happiness turns to fear. I feel pale, not that I change colour. This brightness captures me, conquers me and yet burns me. I look around, trying to find a single hint of my being. I try to control my disquietude. But my being wonders. . . <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <!-- <pre>code goes here</pre> -->
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            And then his shadow falls across the gleaming light. His being has grown small since I last saw him. The shadow tells his hunch is now prominent. I silently pray for him to move. He steps forward, and the blessed shadow falls on me. I feel the coolness of his shade, my master, my universe. The creator comes near. He begins to look for a canvas among the dilapidated remains of what once used to be the abode of creation. I twist and twirl in anticipation as he chooses the colours. His brush strikes the canvas. Colour splashes across his face too. A tiny cringe of a smile spreads across his face as he brushes it off. I reflect and beam in his happiness. His face returns to the usual focussed. He keeps flooding the canvas with colour. Each stroke a different story, a vivid emotion. I stare, astonished, dumfounded at his brilliance. Yet the thought remains, <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p style="text-align:justify;text-justify:inter-word;">
            A sudden jolt wakes me up. I feel my being swayed from the palette. I touch the canvas with fervour as the brush moves away. A new home again , as I glean with happiness. But the emotion ceases as my master brow creases with disapproval. He dips the brush in a new colour and goes on. I shudder with heightened fear. <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
          </p>
          <p>
            What am I? A tiny detail on this giant canvas. Maybe her bindi, maybe a freckle on her saari. . .
            He continues to add details to her, feverish, with a certain urgency. He knew this would be his last.
            I stay humble, calm and relaxed. But my heart pounds every time he runs the brush on the canvas.
            <em>Will I remain, will I cease?</em>
